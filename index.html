        <h2>Project Summary:</h2>
        <p> The large concentration contrast of nitrogen (N) between Earth's atmosphere (78%) and mantle-derived
            materials (ppm-level) makes it a sensitive tracer for interactions between Earth's interior and exterior
            reservoirs. This has led to numerous studies exploiting nitrogen isotopes (δ<sup>15</sup>N) in
            mantle-derived fluids
            and rocks to address issues such as the origin of volatiles in the terrestrial mantle, reservior development
            and mantle mixing over Earth history, ingassing and outgassing fluxes between terrestrial reservoirs, the
            degassing history of Earth and the formation of Earth's atmosphere. The foundation of many of these studies
            is based on the interpretation of high-quality δ<sup>15</sup>N data from mantle-derived materials (i.e.,
            oceanic
            basalts and mantle xenoliths), many of which contain extremely small amounts of N. However, the published
            oceanic basalt δ<sup>15</sup>N database remains surprising small, particularly for major tessestrial
            reservoirs such as
            the oceanic mantle. Recently, the Barry Lab has developed the analytical capability of making low-level
            δ<sup>15</sup>N
            measurements using a dedicated purification and extraction system, which is interfaced to a Nu Noblesse mass
            spectrometer at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. This system is uniquely designed for simultaneous
            multi-collection, which enables measurement of N-isotopes in exceedingly small samples. Key mantle-derived
            samples have been selected and analyzed at the Barry lab. These samples are derived from ocean islands,
            spreading ridge axes, and backarc basins - encompassinhg submarine basalts, mantle xenoliths and mafic
            crystals. </p>
